# Chatbot
A local general knowledge chatbot using Mistral (via Ollama) and LangChain. It runs fully offline on your machine, remembers chat context with buffer memory (without showing history), and is built with Python + Streamlit. Great for testing local LLMs in a simple, private, and interactive setup.
